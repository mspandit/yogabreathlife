		<h1>Modularity Theme <span>Instructions</span></h1>
		
		<h3>About this theme</h3>
		<p>Modularity is a multimedia theme framework for Wordpress.  The theme design was developed with users who appreciate visual browsing and prefer a minimal layout, with their photos and multimedia featured front and center.  But, the theme can been used to create everything from e-commerce sites, music review sites, portfolio sites, and everything in between.  In the future, we will be releasing "child themes" to provide design alternative and additional applications that will work with Modularity.  You'll definitely want to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GraphPaperPress">subscribe to GraphPaperPress.com</a> to get all the latest developments and enhancements for Modularity.</p>
		
		<h3>Best Practices</h3>
		<p>If you want to make changes to how Modularity looks and feels, than create a child theme for Modularity.  Never make changes to the Modularity theme files.  Why?  Because when a new version of Modularity is released, all of your changes will be lost when you update Modularity.  Plus, making a child theme is incredibly easy.  <a href="http://op111.net/p53">Here is how you do it.</a></p>
		
		<h3>Installing this theme</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Unzip the folder contained in the archive to your computer</li>
			<li>Upload the folder and its contents to the themes directory of your blog, located in <strong>&quot;wp-content/themes&quot;</strong> where WordPress is installed.</li>
			<li>Click on Appearance - Themes menu from the WP admin panel, then select the theme to activate.</li>
		  <li>Click on View Site at the top of the page.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Initial Setup</h3>
		<p>Modularity is a 950px wide, one or two column theme, depending on options you have chosen.  We need to set up your default image and thumbnail sizes to allow for easy posting and consistent design structure.  Click <strong>Settings - Media</strong> and <strong>set your thumbnail size</strong> to <strong>150px wide by 150px tall</strong>. Set your <strong>medium size</strong> images to <strong>590px wide and 590px tall</strong>.  Set your <strong>large size</strong> images to <strong>950px wide and 950px tall</strong>.  Post thumbnails are generated automatically by the functions contained in this theme.  By default, the theme pulls in the <strong>latest image</strong> uploaded to the post.  There is no need to use custom fields for adding post thumbnails.  Simply upload your images using Wordpress' new Add Media button, write a caption and description and click save.  While the theme will pull in the thumbnail automatically, it will not add the medium or large sized image to your post automatically.  For that, just click the insert image button just as you normally would.  If you need additional instructions on uploading photos, inserting photo galleries and using the Wordpress interface, please view this <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-rc2/">screencast</a>.</p>
		
		<h3>Theme Options Page</h3>
		<p>Click Appearance - Theme Options.  On this page you can modify background colors, link colors, add your contact info, welcome message and tracking code without touch a single line of code.  You can also add and remove applications, or "apps" as I like to call them.  You can read more about each "app" on the theme options page.</p>
		
		<h3>Widgets</h3>
		<p>There are a total of four widgetized areas on this theme.  The sidebar is a widget called, you guessed it, Sidebar.  It appears on the homepage only when the blog app is enabled.  The bottom three-column area is 100% widgetized.  From Left, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Middle, and Bottom-Right.  You can add and delete widgets by clicking Design - Widgets, from within your Wordpress admin panel.</p>
		
		<h3>Video & Multimedia</h3>
		<p>Modularity has a built-in HD video player that plays both FLV and MOV (H.264) video files.  You are no longer restricted to pixelated YouTube videos.  To add a video, upload the FLV or MOV (H.264) file to your server using your favorite method, like FTP.  Copy and paste the link to the file into a custom field called "video".  Next, add a video thumbnail.  You can do this the exact way that you add regular thumbnails, except, you will want to add an image large enough to fit the maximum size of the video player.  Add the video thumbnail to a custom field with key value "video-thumb".  You can also add other multimedia, which can include virtually any media with embed capabilities.  Enter "multimedia" as the key value and paste your YouTube, Vimeo, or any other html embed code into the value field.  You can read more about the <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/technologies/h264/">video compression H264 here</a>.  You can read more about using custom fields <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2007/10/24/using-wordpress-custom-fields-introduction">here.</a></p>
		
		<h3>Display Content from Specific Categories</h3>
		<p>Lets say that you want to limit the <b>Slider</b> or <b>Featured</b> apps to just display content from a specific category.  Open up the featured.php and slider.php files located in modularity/library/apps/ in a text editor.  Locate this line of code:</p>  <p><code>$my_query = new WP_Query("showposts=1"); ?></code></p>  <p>Add</p> <p><code>&category_name=News</code></p> <p>to the end of</p> <p><code>showposts=1</code></p>  <p>You new code should look like this:</p>  <p><code>$my_query = new WP_Query("showposts=1&category_name=News"); ?></code></p>  <p>This will pull posts from the News category.  If you want to pull posts from multiple categories, you can replace</p> <p><code>category_name=News</code></p> <p>with</p> <p><code>cat=1,5,9</code></p> <p>to pull posts from categories with the <a href="http://graphpaperpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/category-id.jpg">category id's</a> of 1, 5, and 9.</p>
